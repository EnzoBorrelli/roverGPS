# MapBox with react and typescript

this is a small react app that i implemented in the [Roverta Project](https://github.com/proyectoymontajes/Roverta), A mars Rover like robot we developed in the electronics workshop at the technical school.
The original repo is in spanish


## Appendix

This map has been developed using React with TypeScript and implemented using the mapbox-gl library. The corresponding application was created using MIT's App Inventor. The GPS functionality of the mobile device is utilized to obtain latitude and longitude, and these data are sent to a Firebase database connected to the app. The automatically detected value is reflected on the web page, and simultaneously, the marker on the map is updated accordingly.

For the application to work correctly, it is necessary to have the web app hosted (either locally or remotely) and the Android app installed on a mobile device.
